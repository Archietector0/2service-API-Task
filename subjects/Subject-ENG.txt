Project Description:

This project entails the development of two essential services: a user service and an activity history service.
The user service is tasked with providing three critical endpoints:

User Creation: Implement the functionality to create new user profiles.
User Modification: Develop the capability to modify existing user information.
User Retrieval: Implement an endpoint to retrieve a comprehensive list of users.
Additionally, it is imperative to ensure seamless communication between these services. Specifically,
user creation events and subsequent modifications must be diligently transmitted to the User Activity History service.
This ensures a robust tracking system for all user-related actions.

Activity History Service Requirements:

The Activity History Service, in particular, should be equipped with a robust mechanism to meticulously record user actions.
This history must be accessible through endpoints with filtering capabilities based on user identifiers.
Moreover, it should support pagination, enabling users to navigate through the history page by page.

Implementation Guidelines:
Service Communication: The communication methods between the services are flexible and can be tailored according to the project's requirements.
There are no strict constraints on the communication protocols.

Technology Choices:
The both services can be developed using TypeScript (TS). The usage of TypeScript enhances code reliability and maintainability.
The project utilizes PostgreSQL as the Database Management System (DBMS). This choice ensures data consistency and reliability.
By adhering to these guidelines and requirements, the project will deliver a seamless user service, complemented by a robust activity history service.
The implementation should prioritize clarity, scalability, and maintainability to ensure the project's long-term success.
